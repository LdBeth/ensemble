This is a modified version of Ensemble to be used by MetaPRL with
a recent OCaml compiler.

currently working in progress

The key difference between orginal Ensemble:

1. Only the server files are avaliable, no client library.
2. Dropped support for Win32 since it isn't likely to be used.
3. Dropped MD5 and crypto, since they're just stubs if dependecies are not avaliable.
